# Google AI/ML Virtual Internship Exercises

This repository contains my code submissions for the Google AI/ML Virtual Internship, conducted in collaboration with AICTE and EduSkills. The collection covers foundational to intermediate concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning using Python and TensorFlow, with hands-on projects applying core ML, deep learning, and computer vision techniques.

## Project Highlights

- **Hands-on tasks:** Each Python script represents an exercise or project from the internship, reinforcing core AI and ML concepts with practical code.
- **Deep Learning and Computer Vision:** Multiple scripts implement convolutional neural networks for tasks like image classification and object detection.
- **TensorFlow-centric:** Most code uses TensorFlow/Keras frameworks, reflecting industry-standard practice.
- **Progressive Learning:** Exercises range from simple neural network tasks to advanced visualizations and prediction challenges.
